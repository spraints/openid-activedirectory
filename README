A bridge between Active Directory and OpenID.

The idea is to have IIS perform Windows Authentication, and then let a ruby
app do the OpenID dance.

My goal is to get SSO with all the OpenID-enabled web apps that I want to
install on our LAN. (e.g. gitorious, gerrit)


Requirements
============

This is what i'm using. Other versions may work.

IronRuby 1.1 for .NET 4.0
Bundler 1.0.rc.3
IIS 7
Installation

(ironruby) bundle install

(ironruby) rake aspnet

Create an IIS site that is rooted at public in this directory. Enable
Anonymous and Windows authentication. Use the integrated pipeline, v4.0,
32-bit .NET stuff.


Try it out
==========

Visit http://youropenidhost/.
This will redirect you to your identity page (assuming everything works).
Copy the URL of this page into an OpenID login box.
